# Ground Station Optimization and Performance Analysis for Drone Networks
Conducted an optimization and performance analysis study for ground station placement in drone networks using Python. Implemented seven different optimization algorithms (PSO, GWO, ACO, GA, DEA, GOA, ABC) across three distinct scenarios to assign drones to optimal ground station locations. Evaluated and compared algorithm performance thoroughly, presenting efficiency and accuracy results through detailed visual analyses.
